      <h1>My Thoughts on the Nintendo E3 Direct</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>For a lot of Nintendo fans, the last few directs have been quite disappointing. I personally do not agree with this notion but can definitely understand where they are coming from. However, there is no doubt in my mind that this nintendo direct was one of the greatest and most jam-packed ones to date. Nintendo really hit it out of the park with this one. In this article I will mostly only be covering notable 1st party announcements but I will gloss over a few third party announcements that I personally found exciting.</p>
        <h2>My hopes going into the direct</h2>
          <p>I had some wishes for the direct before watching it. Some of these however are pretty ridiculous so I will be breaking it up into things that I thought might have a chance appearing in the direct, and others that seemed like a longshot</p>
            <h3>Possibilities</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Hyrule Warriors DLC</strong> - It felt like enough time had passed to justify DLC (though I'm never a huge fan of DLC in general)</li>
                <li><strong>New Smash Character</strong> - It's always cool to see a new character be cemented in gaming history, even if I don't play smash all that much</li>
                <li><strong>Zelda 30th Anniversary Collection announcement</strong> - Something similar to the Mario 3D All Stars collection with games such as, Windwaker, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess (since a skyward sword port has already been announced)</li>
                <li><strong>Danganronpa Trilogy Port</strong> - <a href="blog.html">I have already played through all the games</a> but I fell like it would be a great fit for the nintendo switch platform in general. In addition, Spike Chunsoft has already had Robotics Notes ported to the switch which somewhat led me to believe that a Danganronpa port was a possibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Fantasy VI and IV Port</strong> - They have already ported a lot of the games so I feel like this would just be a no-brainer for Square Enix... </li>
                <li><strong>News Regarding Metroid Prime 4</strong> - It's been a while... </li>
                <li><strong>New Trailer for Shin Megami Tensei 5</strong> - I'm really hyped for this game! </li>
                <li><strong>Breath of the Wild 2 News + Trailer</strong> - We haven't heard much about this game for the last 2 years, it would be nice to have a ball park release date, though if there is little progress in development, it would make sense if its not brought up. </li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Pretty Unlikely</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Fire Emblem: the Three Houses DLC wave</strong> - I feel like there is so much that could expanded upon in this game (I'll probably talk about it in the future) but I feel like that ship has sailed...</li>
                <li><strong>Earthbound Port on SNES classic</strong> - I have no idea why they haven't put this on the platform yet, especially since they have ported it to new nintendo 3ds and the SNES classic prior to this</li>
                <li><strong>More News About Project: Triangle Strategy</strong> - I really enjoyed Octopath Traveler and am super excited for this game, but I am doubtful that they will mention it since we already got news about it not too long ago</li>
                <li><strong>Kerbal Space Program Port</strong> -  Idk, I just think that would be neat</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>When Pigs Fly</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mother 3 Localization</strong> - Guys, guys, it will happen someday right? Haha...</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reactions</h2>
              <h3>Kazuya in Smash</h3>
                <p>I have never played a Tekken game but he seems pretty neat. I'm happy to see that a representative from a series that has not been featured in smash yet. Also, his reveal trailer was really fun, especially the part where he is just throwing characters off the cliff, one by one (thank god that Kirby escaped lol). It makes you think though, if he threw Marth off a cliff, will he, similar to <em>another fire emblem representative</em>, wake up in five years to a war-torn land? </p>
